vim-hs-type
===========

This plugin starts as a fork of [vim-hdevtools](https://github.com/bitc/vim-hdevtools) and is now in very early stage. It aims to improve getting type information ignoring every other abilities of hdevtools, cause they all are better done by [haskell-ide-engine](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine).
